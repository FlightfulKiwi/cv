  <p>I am a Mechanical Engineer at Northrop Grumman. I am currently overseeing the design of various antenna types and the components needed to support their integration within a much larger spacecraft. My work requires continued collaboration with
    several other engineering disciplines (electrical, manufacturing, materials, thermal, ESD, systems, etc.) to ensure that the design solutions we propose meet the requirements flowed down by our customers, are designed with manufacturability in
    mind, and can meet several other engineering criteria. We aim to leverage and improve upon existing designs/crafts currently in space. My job does not end with the creation and submission of detailed models and drawings; we remain involve through
    every subsequent stage: manufacturing, testing, and integration.</p>
